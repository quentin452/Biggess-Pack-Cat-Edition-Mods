Version 2.5-BETA
----------------------
Why BETA? - because included are some untested changes meant for version 3.0.
-Made is so that no other mod can by-pass Treasure Chest locks (ex. BuildCraft, Ender IO, ExtraUtilities, Tinker's Construct).  This replaces the previous
	change that only affected those listed mods. (done by not extending TileEntityChest and not implementing IInventory).
-Removed the checks against specific mods and the relevent config properties.
-Vanilla chests and Treasure Chests now work together without issue - no rendering issues, can place beside each other.
-Fixed the BiomeDictionary error.
-Using Plans v3.0

Version 2.4
-----------------
-Added checks when playing with BuildCraft, Ender IO, and ExtraUtilities, to behave the same as with Tinker's Construct (that is, you can't place a Treasure
	Chest beside a Block from these mods that gains access to the chest and vice versa).
-Added config properties to enable\disable these checks.
-Fixed Wither Spawner Log from dropping a Wither Spawner Log item, but will drop a regular Wither Log.
-Added a config property for Wither Branches and Wither Roots to control the % chance that they will drop themselves as an item.  Changed the default
	from 25% to 35%.

Version 2.3
-----------------
-Added custom TreasureBiomeDictionary class.
-Added custom DEEP_OCEAN BiomeDictionary.Type.
-Updated all chest, ship, well, wither tree, and building generation to use BiomeDictionary and TreasureBiomeDictionary instead of interrogating the biome name.
-Added configurable (config file) white/black lists for biome Types for chests, ships, wells, wither tree, and buildings.
-Re-organized config file in more logical categories, hopefully making it more user-friendly and easier to understand configuration settings.
-Added many comments to config categories and properties.
-Fixed PaintingPlacholderTileEntity is missing a mapping error.
-Added a medieval townhouse Plan to the forest buildings.

Version 2.2
-----------------
-Fixed Wither Spawner Log name to display correctly.
-When playing with Tinker's Construct mod, if a Tinker's Crafting Station (or vanilla chest) is placed beside a Treasure chest, 
	the Treasure chest will "pop/break" to item form with all items intact.  By default, that means it will be locked again.  The opposite is also true - 
	if a Treasure chest is placed beside a Crafting Station, the chest will "pop/break".
-Added a config property (true/false) to test for Tinker's Construct, so Treasure mod will work even if you don't have Tinker's Construct mod.
-Added a series of white/black list config properties for which Biome Types a Treasure Ship can generate in.

Version 2.1.1
-----------------

-Fixed Skeleton Warrior not having its name set.
-Added 2 new ships from the Plans contest. 1 large for Deep Ocean and 1 medium for Ocean.

Version 2.0
---------------

-Pirate and Dread Pirate chests - added % chance to drop mob heads.
-Fixed: when breaking chests, they do not unlock.  That kinda defeated the purpose of keys.  So even if they blow up, they shouldn't lose their items, but you'll probably die.
-Fixed: gravestones and bones should no longer be placed on top of each other or on treasure chests or inside of trees.
-Fixed issue with too many wishing wells generating after the first one is generated.
